    "### 3 Main Categories\n",
    "Before we dive into handling missing data, let's explore the three basic categories of missing data. The categories are also part of the CompTIA Data+ certification exam so it's good to know them, even at a high-level.\n",

    "### Delete, Recode, or Impute? That's the question!\n",
    "#### Deleting\n",
    "Missing values or columns with missing values can be deleted in certain situations. For example, you have a large sample of data you plan to use for hypothesis testing. If you have three thousand rows, deleting a few is usually fine.\n",
    "#### Recoding \n",
    "When you have missing data such as payments with a `0` value becuase a customer has not yet paid. You could create a new boolean column names `not_paid` to show why there is a zero (MNAR).\n",
    "#### Imputing \n",
    "Sometimes missing values can be imputed as none for categorial data or `0` for numerical data if it makes sense to do so. We'll explore this further in the upcoming videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Action Steps\n",
    "Research and talk to stakeholders, then consider one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Remove missing data\n",
    "2. Recode missing data\n",
    "3. Impute missing data"
